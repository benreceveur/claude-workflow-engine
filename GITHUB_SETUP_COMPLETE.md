## Features Enabled

### 1. Dependabot - Automated Dependency Management ✅

**Configuration:** `.github/dependabot.yml`

**What it does:**
- **Weekly scans** for npm, pip, and GitHub Actions updates
- **Automatic PRs** for security vulnerabilities (immediate)
- **Grouped updates** for minor/patch versions (reduces PR noise)
- **Auto-assigns** PRs to repository owner
- **Labels** PRs with `dependencies`, `python`, `github-actions`

**Monitoring:**
- npm packages (JavaScript/Node.js)
- pip packages (Python dependencies)
- GitHub Actions workflows

**Schedule:**
- Security updates: Immediate
- Version updates: Weekly (Sundays)
- Open PR limit: 10 for npm, 5 for pip

**Review:**
Check PRs at: https://github.com/benreceveur/claude-workflow-engine/pulls

### 2. Security Policy ✅

**File:** `.github/SECURITY.md`

**What it provides:**
- **Vulnerability reporting** guidelines
- **Supported versions** documentation (v3.x supported)
- **Response timeline** commitments
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 14 days
  - Medium: 30 days
- **Security best practices** for users and contributors
- **Known security considerations** for MCP servers, Python deps, etc.

**Reporting:**
- Private security advisories: https://github.com/benreceveur/claude-workflow-engine/security/advisories/new
- Public disclosure only after fix is released

---

### 3. GitHub Actions Security Scanning ✅

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/security.yml`

**Automated Scans:**

#### On Every Push/PR:
1. **NPM Security Audit**
   - Checks JavaScript dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Fails on moderate+ severity issues
   - Creates audit artifacts

2. **CodeQL Analysis**
   - Static code analysis for JavaScript and Python
   - Detects security vulnerabilities, bugs, and code quality issues
   - GitHub's native security scanning

3. **Dependency Review** (PRs only)
   - Reviews new dependencies added in PRs
   - Blocks PRs with known vulnerabilities
   - Checks license compatibility

4. **Secret Scanning**
   - TruffleHog scans for leaked secrets
   - API keys, tokens, credentials
   - Prevents accidental commits of sensitive data

#### Weekly Schedule:
- Runs every Sunday at midnight UTC
- Full security audit even without commits
- Catches newly disclosed vulnerabilities
