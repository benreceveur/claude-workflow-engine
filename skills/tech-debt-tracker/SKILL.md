# Technical Debt Management System

## Purpose

The **tech-debt-tracker** Skill provides automated technical debt identification, measurement, tracking, and prioritization. It scans codebases for debt indicators (complexity, duplication, outdated patterns), calculates objective metrics, prioritizes debt by business impact, and creates actionable backlog items.

Only **7.2% of developers** track technical debt methodically, creating a massive opportunity for systematic debt management. Proper technical debt tracking can lead to **50% faster delivery** by focusing refactoring efforts on highest-impact areas.

### When to Use This Skill

Use `tech-debt-tracker` when you need to:
- **Identify technical debt** in a codebase systematically
- **Quantify debt metrics** (SQALE, cognitive complexity, code churn)
- **Prioritize refactoring efforts** by business impact and effort
- **Track debt trends** over time and across sprints
- **Generate debt reports** for stakeholders and planning
- **Create backlog items** for debt paydown work
- **Prevent debt accumulation** through early detection

### When NOT to Use This Skill

- For simple code review feedback (use `code-reviewer` agent)
- For immediate refactoring work (use `refactor-automator` skill when available)
- For style/formatting issues (use `code-formatter` skill)
- For security vulnerabilities (use `security-scanner` skill)
- When you need architectural analysis (use `architect-reviewer` agent)

codebase-navigator analyze

# Then, identify debt in discovered hotspots
tech-debt-tracker scan --focus-on-hotspots
```

### Works with `code-formatter`
```bash
# Format code before analyzing complexity
code-formatter format

# Then check if complexity improved
tech-debt-tracker calculate-metrics
```

### Works with `semantic-search`
```bash
# Find similar debt patterns across codebase
semantic-search find-similar --pattern="high complexity authentication"

# Track all instances of this debt type
tech-debt-tracker scan --filter="authentication complexity"
```

### Works with `test-first-change`
```bash

## Token Economics

### Without tech-debt-tracker Skill

**Manual Approach** (using agents):
```
1. User asks: "What's our technical debt situation?"
2. Claude analyzes codebase with agents (15,000 tokens)
3. Calculates metrics manually (8,000 tokens)
4. Generates recommendations (5,000 tokens)
5. Creates backlog items (4,000 tokens)

Total: ~32,000 tokens per debt analysis
Time: 15-20 minutes
```

### With tech-debt-tracker Skill

**Automated Approach**:
```
1. Skill metadata loaded: 50 tokens
2. User: "Scan project for technical debt"
3. Skill triggered, SKILL.md loaded: 500 tokens
4. Execute scan operation: 0 tokens (code execution)
5. Return structured results: 200 tokens

Total: ~750 tokens per analysis
Time: 30-45 seconds
Execution: ~35ms
```

**Token Savings**: 31,250 tokens (97.7% reduction)
**Time Savings**: 14-19 minutes (95% reduction)

### ROI Calculation

**Scenario**: Medium team (20 developers), bi-weekly debt analysis

**Without Skill**:
- 26 analyses per year
- 832,000 tokens per year
- ~$2.50 per analysis at $3/1M tokens
- **Annual cost: $65**
- **Time cost**: 390-520 minutes/year (6.5-8.7 hours)

**With Skill**:
- 26 analyses per year
- 19,500 tokens per year
- ~$0.06 per analysis
- **Annual cost: $1.50**
- **Time cost**: 13-20 minutes/year
- **Savings: $63.50 + 6-8 hours of developer time**

**Additional Value**:
- 50% faster delivery through focused refactoring
- Reduced production bugs from addressing high-risk debt
- Better sprint planning with quantified debt metrics
- Improved team morale through systematic debt reduction

```

**Result:**
```
Found 87 debt items:
  - Critical: 3 (payment processing complexity)
  - High: 12 (missing test coverage in auth)
  - Medium: 45 (code duplication in utilities)

SQALE Index: 15 days (5.2% debt ratio)
Rating: B

Top 3 Priority Items:
1. src/payments/PaymentProcessor.js - Complexity 32 (4h effort)
2. src/auth/SessionManager.js - No test coverage (2h effort)
3. src/api/UserController.js - Duplicated validation (1h effort)

Recommended: Fix top 3 items this sprint (7h total, 12% debt reduction)
```

### Example 2: Sprint Planning

**User Prompt:**
> "What technical debt should we tackle this sprint? We have 20 hours capacity."

**Skill Execution:**
```json
{
  "operation": "prioritize",
  "project_dir": ".",
  "prioritization_strategy": "impact_effort_ratio",
  "business_context": {
    "team_capacity": "20 hours"
  }
}
```

**Result:**
```
Sprint Debt Backlog (20 hours capacity):

This Sprint (18 hours):
1. Fix payment complexity (4h) - Critical
2. Add session tests (2h) - High
3. Refactor duplicate validation (1h) - Medium
4. Extract helpers from UserService (3h) - Medium
5. Update deprecated API calls (4h) - Medium
6. Add error handling tests (4h) - Medium

Expected Impact: 15% debt reduction, focus on critical paths

Quick Wins (bonus if time available):
- Remove unused imports (0.5h)
- Fix inconsistent naming (1h)
```

### Example 3: Trend Monitoring

**User Prompt:**
> "Show me how our technical debt has changed over the last month"

**Skill Execution:**
```json
{
  "operation": "track",
  "project_dir": ".",
  "time_range": "last_30_days"
}
```

**Result:**
```
Technical Debt Trend (Sep 20 - Oct 20):

Debt Added: 450 points
Debt Removed: 320 points
Net Change: +130 points (17% increase)
Trend: ⚠️  INCREASING

Current State:
- Total Items: 87 (was 75)
- SQALE Days: 15 (was 12)
- Debt Ratio: 5.2% (was 4.8%)

Analysis:

  "success": true,
  "info": "Large codebase detected (500k LOC), analysis may take 2-3 minutes",
  "progress": "Analyzing... 45% complete"
}
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Scanning
- Run debt scans weekly or bi-weekly
- Track trends over time to prevent accumulation
- Set debt ratio thresholds (e.g., <5% is healthy)

### 2. Prioritization Strategy
- Focus on critical business paths first
- Balance quick wins with high-impact items
- Consider upcoming planned changes
- Factor in team capacity realistically

### 3. Sprint Allocation
- Allocate 10-20% of sprint capacity to debt paydown
- Track debt velocity (added vs. removed)
- Celebrate debt reduction milestones

### 4. Prevention
- Run scans in CI/CD to catch new debt early
- Set quality gates to prevent debt introduction
- Review debt metrics in code review process

### 5. Team Engagement
- Share debt reports in sprint planning
- Make debt visible through dashboards
- Gamify debt reduction (leaderboards, badges)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Scan taking too long
**Solution**: Use `include_patterns` to focus on specific directories:
```json
{
  "operation": "scan",
  "include_patterns": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude_patterns": ["**/*.test.js", "node_modules/**"]
}
```

### Issue: Too many false positives
**Solution**: Adjust thresholds in `.techdebtrc.json`:
```json
{
